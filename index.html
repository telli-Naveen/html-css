      Saravanan Sivakumar (born 23 July 1975), known by his stage name Suriya, is an Indian actor, producer, television presenter and a philanthropist.
      Suriya is the eldest child of actor Sivakumar and his younger brother Karthi is also an actor. He married co-star Jyothika in 2006. In 2008, he began Agaram Foundation, which funds various philanthropic activities. In 2013, Suriya founded the production house 2D Entertainment.

    Before his career in films, Suriya worked at a garment exports factory for eight months. To avoid nepotism, he did not reveal himself to his boss as Sivakumar's son, but his boss ultimately learnt the truth himself.

    Suriya and his family has also extended help towards the education of Sri Lankan Tamil children on behalf of the Sivakumar Charitable Trust. He is also an active participant in other humanitarian works such as "Save The Tigers" campaign, which aids in the protection and preservation of Tigers in India, and "REACH", a non-profit that cures TB patients for free using supervised medication programs.[99] The actor celebrates every birthday by doing charity work across Tamil Nadu.
    Suriya is currently acting in the untitled Bala film, which is produced by himself. For this purpose three houses have been built in Kanyakumari. Instead of demolishing the houses on the sets after shooting, Suriya decided to give them to the poor fishermen of Kanyakumari for free.

    In 2006, Suriya began the Agaram Foundation, working to help children who drop out of school early in Tamil Nadu. Suriya revealed that he was inspired to begin the movement as a result of his father's own organisation, Sivakumar Educational Trust, which had been operating similar benefits on a smaller scale since the 1980s.

    With the firm belief that the educated mind can not only eliminate social evils but also aid in the socio-economic upbringing of society, Agaram Foundation works towards providing appropriate learning opportunities to the rural populace who do not otherwise have access to quality education. Through the foundation, he has also set up a platform for students to participate in workshops and improve communication skills, teamwork, goal setting and leadership.
